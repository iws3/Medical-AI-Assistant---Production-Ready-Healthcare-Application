# Production-Ready Medical AI Assistant

**Author:** Precious T.

---

## Project Overview
This project builds a medical AI assistant using **Python**, **FastAPI**, **Tavili**, **Gemini**, and **LangChain**.  
It’s designed to answer patient questions, suggest possible diagnoses, and pull in evidence-based info from trusted APIs.  
The system is modular and ready for use in a real-world production environment.

## ⚙️ Main Components

### FastAPI Endpoints
- `POST /ask` – Accepts user medical questions  
- `GET /history` – Retrieves past conversations  
- `POST /feedback` – Collects user feedback for ongoing improvements  

### LangChain Integration
- Uses prompt templates to structure medical queries  
- Keeps conversation context with memory  

### Gemini Model
- Core language model generating answers  
- Fine-tuned specifically for safe medical information  

### Tavili Vector DB
- Stores trusted medical documents  
- Allows semantic search to enrich answers with relevant knowledge  

### Security & Compliance
- Basic authentication and API key protection  
- Designed to handle data carefully, similar to HIPAA standards (no logging of personal health info)

## Implementation Plan

- Build the FastAPI structure and endpoints  
- Connect LangChain and Gemini for answering questions  
- Integrate Tavili for knowledge retrieval and context handling  
- Add authentication, logging, and deploy to production  

---

## Deployment
- Package the app using **Docker**  
- Deploy securely to platforms like Render or Heroku with **HTTPS**  
- Manage secrets through environment variables

## Current Status
Due to a power outage, I’ve completed the architecture and design so far.  
Full code will be pushed as soon as power is back.  
I’m also open to teaming up with a teammate tonight to speed things along.
